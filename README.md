Pygame Projects ðŸŽ®

About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Naobi Quines, and this repository is a collection of my Pygame projects. Anything related to Pygame is pushed here as part of my learning journey. This is a learning repository, which means that each project has a documented file explaining the code to help understand how everything works.

Pygame Initialization âš¡

This environment is set up using Pygame. To get started with Pygame, follow these steps:

ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Install Python

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from:

To keep dependencies clean, create a virtual environment:

python -m venv pygame_env

Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

pygame_env\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux:

source pygame_env/bin/activate

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Install Pygame

Install Pygame using pip:

pip install pygame

To verify installation, run:

python -m pygame.examples.aliens

If you see a game window pop up, Pygame is successfully installed! âœ…
